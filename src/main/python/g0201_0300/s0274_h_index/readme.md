## 274\. H-Index

Medium

Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> paper, return compute the researcher's `h`**\-index**.

According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): A scientist has an index `h` if `h` of their `n` papers have at least `h` citations each, and the other `n âˆ’ h` papers have no more than `h` citations each.

If there are several possible values for `h`, the maximum one is taken as the `h`**\-index**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** citations = [3,0,6,1,5]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

    [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
    Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3. 

**Example 2:**

**Input:** citations = [1,3,1]

**Output:** 1 

**Constraints:**

*   `n == citations.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 5000`
*   `0 <= citations[i] <= 1000`

## Solution

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def hIndex(self, citations: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(citations)
        freq = [0] * (n + 1)
        for c in citations:
            freq[min(c, n)] += 1
        total = 0
        for h in range(n, 0, -1):
            total += freq[h]
            if total >= h:
                return h
        return 0
```
