## 137\. Single Number II

Medium

Given an integer array `nums` where every element appears **three times** except for one, which appears **exactly once**. _Find the single element and return it_.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [2,2,3,2]

**Output:** 3 

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]

**Output:** 99 

**Constraints:**

*   <code>1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10<sup>4</sup></code>
*   <code>-2<sup>31</sup> <= nums[i] <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1</code>
*   Each element in `nums` appears exactly **three times** except for one element which appears **once**.

## Solution

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        ones = 0
        twos = 0
        for num in nums:
            ones = (ones ^ num) & (~twos)
            twos = (twos ^ num) & (~ones)
        return ones
```
