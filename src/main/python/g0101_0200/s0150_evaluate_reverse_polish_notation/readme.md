## 150\. Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation

Medium

Evaluate the value of an arithmetic expression in [Reverse Polish Notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation).

Valid operators are `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`. Each operand may be an integer or another expression.

**Note** that division between two integers should truncate toward zero.

It is guaranteed that the given RPN expression is always valid. That means the expression would always evaluate to a result, and there will not be any division by zero operation.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** tokens = ["2","1","+","3","\*"]

**Output:** 9

**Explanation:** ((2 + 1) \* 3) = 9 

**Example 2:**

**Input:** tokens = ["4","13","5","/","+"]

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:** (4 + (13 / 5)) = 6 

**Example 3:**

**Input:** tokens = ["10","6","9","3","+","-11","\*","/","\*","17","+","5","+"]

**Output:** 22

**Explanation:**

    ((10 \* (6 / ((9 + 3) \* -11))) + 17) + 5
    = ((10 \* (6 / (12 \* -11))) + 17) + 5
    = ((10 \* (6 / -132)) + 17) + 5
    = ((10 \* 0) + 17) + 5
    = (0 + 17) + 5
    = 17 + 5
    = 22 

**Constraints:**

*   <code>1 <= tokens.length <= 10<sup>4</sup></code>
*   `tokens[i]` is either an operator: `"+"`, `"-"`, `"*"`, or `"/"`, or an integer in the range `[-200, 200]`.

## Solution

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def evalRPN(self, tokens: List[str]) -> int:
        stack = []
        
        for token in tokens:
            if token in {'+', '-', '*', '/'}:
                b = stack.pop()
                a = stack.pop()
                if token == '+':
                    stack.append(a + b)
                elif token == '-':
                    stack.append(a - b)
                elif token == '*':
                    stack.append(a * b)
                elif token == '/':
                    # Truncate toward zero
                    stack.append(int(a / b))
            else:
                stack.append(int(token))
        
        return stack[0]
```
